# Yocto/Bvh: Accelerated ray-intersection and point-overlap

Yocto/Bvh provides ray-intersection and point-overlap queries accelerated
by a two-level BVH using an internal or wrapping Embree.
Yocto/Bvh is implemented in `yocto_bvh.h` and `yocto_bvh.cpp`.

**This library is experimental** and will be documented appropriately when
the code reaches stability.
