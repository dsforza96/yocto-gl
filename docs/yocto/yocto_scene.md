# Yocto/Scene: Scene representation

Yocto/Scene define a simple scene representation, and related utilities,
used to write other libraries in Yocto/GL.
Yocto/Scene is implemented in `yocto_scene.h` and `yocto_scene.cpp`.

## Scene representation

Scenes are stored in `scene_model` structs and are comprised of array
of objects whose memory is owned by the scene.
Scenes are comprised of camera, instances, shapes, materials, textures
and environments. Animation is not currently supported.
The scene representation is geared toward modeling physically-based environments. In Yocto/Scene, lights are not explicitly defined, but
implicitly comprised of instances with emissive materials and environment maps.
All scenes and objects properties are accessible directly.
Some scene data, like lights and ray-acceleration structures,
are computed when necessary and should not be accessed directly.

All scenes objects have names that have to be unique and
are used for both UI and serialization. Cameras, instances and environments
have coordinate frames to define the local to world transformation.
Frames are presented as affine 3x4 matrices and are intended to be
rigid transforms, although most scene processing support frames with
scaling.

**Cameras**, represented by `scene_camera`, are based on a simple lens model.
Cameras coordinate systems are defined by their frame.
Cameras projections are described in photographic terms. In particular,
we specify film size (35mm by default), film aspect ration,
the lens' focal length, the focus distance and the lens aperture.
All values are in meters. We support both perspective and orthographic cameras,
but prefer the former.

Common aspect ratios used in video and still photography are
3:2 on 35 mm (0.036 x 0.024),
16:9 on 35 mm (0.036 x 0.02025 or 0.04267 x 0.024),
2.35:1 on 35 mm (0.036 x 0.01532 or 0.05640 x 0.024),
2.39:1 on 35 mm (0.036 x 0.01506 or 0.05736 x 0.024),
2.40:1 on 35 mm (0.036 x 0.015 or 0.05760 x 0.024).
To compute good apertures, one can use the F-stop number from photography
and set the aperture to focal length over f-stop.

**Textures**, represented as `scene_texture` contain either 8-bit LDR or
32-bit float HDR images of either scalar or color (RGB) type.
HDR images are encoded in linear color space, while LDR images
are encoded in sRGB.

**Materials** are modeled similarly to the
[Disney Principled BSDF](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/#course_content) and the
[Autodesk Standard Surface](https://autodesk.github.io/standard-surface/).
Materials are defined using many parameters that control material emission,
surface scattering and homogeneous volumetric scattering.
Each material parameter has an associated texture, where texture values are
multiplied by parameter values.

Materials specify a diffuse surface emission `emission` with HDR values
that represent emitted radiance.

Surface scattering is modeled by defining the main surface
color `color`, that represent the surface albedo.
Specular reflection is modeled by default as a dielectric with index of
refraction `ior`, roughness `roughness` and is scaled by a specular
weight `specular`. By default, specular reflection is dielectric.
Materials can reflect light as metals by setting the `metallic` parameter.
In this case, a metallic specular reflection is defined by the surface color
interpreted as metallic reflectivity, and surface roughness defined by
the previous parameter. Surfaces are optionally covered by a coating layer
defined by a `coat` parameter. By default surfaces are fully opaque, but
can defined a `opacity` parameter and texture to define the surface coverage.

Materials also define volumetric scattering properties by setting a
`transmission` parameter that sets the transmitted surface color.
Surfaces are be default considered as thin sheet, but can be modeled as
isotropic volumes if the `thin` parameter is set to false. In that case,
the surface transmission controls the volumetric parameters by defining the
volume density, while the volume scattering albedo is defined by the
`scattering` property.

**Shapes** are represented as indexed meshes of elements using the
`scene_shape` type. Shapes can contain only one type of element, either
points, lines, triangles or quads. Shape elements are parametrized as in
[Yocto/Geometry](yocto_geometry.md).
Vertex properties are defined as separate arrays and include
positions, normals, texture coords, colors, radius and tangent spaces.
Additionally, Yocto/Scenes supports face-varying primitives where
each vertex data has its own topology.

Shapes supports tesselation and displacement mapping. Shape specify a
level of subdivision and can be subdivide elements either linearly
or using Catmull-Clark subdivision. Shapes also support displacement
by specifying both a displacement texture and a displacement amount.
Differently from most systems, in Yocto/Scene displacement is specified
in the shape and not the material, that only controls shading.
Subdivision and displacement are only specified in shapes, but not
taken into account when evaluating shape properties. For this to happen,
shapes have to be tessellated, as shown later.

Shapes are placed in the scene by defining shape **instances** that
take a coordinate frame, a shape pointer and a material pointer.
Instances are represented by the `scene_instance` type.
Instances are represented as `scene_instance` objects. Thought the
use of instancing Yocto/Scene scales well to large environments without
introducing more complex mechanisms.

Scenes might be lit by background illumination defined by **environments**,
represented by the `scene_environment` type. Environments have a frame,
to rotate illumination, an emission term and an optional emission texture.
The emission texture is an HDR environment map stored in a LatLon
parametrization.

## Scene Creation

Objects are added to the scene via `add_XXX(scene,name)` functions,
where `XXX` is the object type name. In these functions,
the name is optional and, if left blank, a unique name will be generated
automatically. For each object type, properties can be set directly.
As a convenience, Yocto/Scene defines several functions to set objects
properties.

For cameras, use `set_frame(camera, frame)` to set the local to world frame,
`set_lens(camera, lens, aspect, film, ortho)` to set the camera projection using
photographic lens parameters, and `set_focus(camera, aperture, focus)` to set
the camera aperture and focus distance.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};          // create a scene
auto camera = add_camera(scene, "cam");  // create a camera named cam
set_frame(camera,identity3x4f);          // set frame to identity
set_lens(camera,0.050,1.5,0.036);     // set as 50mm lens 3:2 aspect on 35mm
set_aperture(camera,0.01,10);            // set 10mm aperture focused at 10m
```

For instances, use `set_frame(instance, frame)` to set the local to world frame,
`set_shape(instance, shape)` and `set_material(instance, material)`
to set the shape and material pointers. Since adding instances of single
shapes is common in simpler scenes, the function
`add_complete_instance(scene, name)` adds an instance with a new shape and
material.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};             // create a scene
auto instance = add_instance(scene, "ist"); // create an instance named ist
set_frame(instance,identity3x4f);           // set frame to identity
auto shape = add_shape(scene, "shp");
set_shape(instance,shape);                  // set shape pointer
auto material = add_material(scene, "mat");
set_material(instance,material);            // set material pointer

auto instance1 = add_complete_instance(scene, "obj");  // create an instance
print_info(instance1->shape);                          // with a new shape
print_info(instance1->material);                       // and  a new material
```

For textures, use `set_texture(texture, img)` to set the texture
to the specified image. The function has overloads for images with
one or three channels and with float or byte channel types.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};             // create a scene
auto texture = add_texture(scene, "tex");   // create a texture named tex
set_texture(texture,image<vec3f>{...});     // set as a color HDR texture
set_texture(texture,image<vec3b>{...});     // set as a color LDR texture
set_texture(texture,image<float>{...});     // set as a scalar HDR texture
set_texture(texture,image<byte >{...});     // set as a scalar LDR texture
```

For materials, Yocto/Scene defines functions to set each material property.
Each functions take as input the parameter value and an optional texture.
Use `set_emission(material, emission, tex)` to set material emission.
Use `set_color(material, color, tex)` to set the surface color,
`set_specular(material, specular, tex)`,
`set_metallic(material, metallic, tex)`,
`set_transmission(material, transmission, tex)`
for specular, metallic and transmission weights,
`set_ior(material, ior)`, `set_roughness(material, roughness, tex)`,
`set_opacity(material, opacity, tex)` for surface ior, roughness and opacity,
`set_scattering(material, scattering,tex)` for volumetric scattering and
`set_thin(material, thin)` for the thin flag.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};               // create a scene
auto matte = add_texture(scene, "matte");     // create a matte material
set_color(matte, {1,0.5,0.5}, add_texture(scene)); // textured albedo
auto plastic = add_texture(scene, "plastic"); // create a plastic material
set_color(plastic, {0.5,1,0.5});              // constant color
set_specular(plastic, 1);                     // constant specular
set_roughness(plastic, 0.1, add_texture(scene)); // textured roughness
auto metal = add_texture(scene, "metal");     // create a metal material
set_color(metal, {0.5,0.5,1});                // constant color
set_specular(metal, 1);                       // constant specular
set_roughness(metal, 0.1);                    // constant roughness
auto tglass = add_texture(scene, "tglass");   // create a thin glass material
set_color(tglass, {1,1,1});                   // constant color
set_specular(tglass, 1);                      // constant specular
set_transmission(tglass, 1);                  // constant transmission
auto glass = add_texture(scene, "glass");     // create a glass material
set_color(glass, {1,1,1});                    // constant color
set_specular(glass, 1);                       // constant specular
set_transmission(glass, 1);                   // constant transmission
set_thin(glass, false);                       // volumetric material
auto subsurf = add_texture(scene, "subsurf"); // create a subsurface material
set_color(subsurf, {1,1,1});                  // constant color
set_specular(subsurf, 1);                     // constant specular
set_transmission(subsurf, 1);                 // constant transmission
set_thin(subsurf, false);                     // volumetric material
set_scattering(subsurf, {0.5,1,0.5});         // volumetric scattering
```

For shapes, Yocto/Scene defines functions to set shape element indices
and vertex properties. Use `set_points(shape, points)`,
`set_lines(shape, lines)`, `set_triangles(shape, triangles)`, and
`set_quads(shape, quads)` to set indexed meshes indices as points, lines,
triangles and quads respectively.
Use `set_positions(shape, positions)`, `set_normals(shape, normals)`,
`set_texcoords(shape, texcoords)`, `set_colors(shape, colors)`,
`set_radius(shape, radius)`, and `set_tangents(shape, tangents)`
to set positions, normals, texture coordinates, colors, radius and
tangent spaces respectively.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};             // create a scene
auto shape = add_shape(scene, "shp");       // create a shape named shp
set_triangles(shape, vector<vec3i>{...});   // set triangle indices
set_positions(shape, vector<vec3f>{...});   // set positions
set_normals(shape, vector<vec3f>{...});     // set normals
set_texcoords(shape, vector<vec2f>{...});   // set texture coordinates
```

Use `set_fvquads(shape, quadspos, quadsnorm, quadsuv)` to set the shapes as
a facce-varying quad mesh. Use `set_displacement(shape, disp, tex)` to
set the displacement map and scale and `set_subdivision(shape, level, cc)`
to set the subdivision level and whether to use Catmull-Clark or linear
subdivision.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};             // create a scene
auto shape = add_shape(scene, "shp");       // create a shape named shp
set_fvquads(shape, vector<vec4i>{...},      // set face-varying indices
  {}, vector<vec4i>{...});                  // for positions and textures
set_positions(shape, vector<vec3f>{...});   // set positions
set_texcoords(shape, vector<vec2f>{...});   // set texture coordinates
set_subdivision(shape, 2, true);            // set Catmull-Clark subdivision
set_displacement(shape, 1, tex);            // sete displacement map tex
```

For environments, use `set_frame(environment, frame)` to set the local to
world frame, `set_emission(instance, emission, emission_tex)` to set the
environment emission and emission texture.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};             // create a scene
auto environment = add_environment(scene, "env"); // create an environment
set_frame(environment, identity3x4f);       // set identity transform
auto tex = add_scene(scene, "sky");         // add hdr texture
set_emission(environment, {1,1,1}, tex);    // add emission scale and texture
```

For quickly creating scenes, Yocto/Scene provides convenience functions
that add missing elements to construct full scenes.
Use `add_cameras(scene)` to add a default camera, `add_materials(scene)`
to add default materials for instances that miss it, `add_radius(scene)`
to add points and lines thickness for rendering, and `add_sky(scene)` to
add a procedural sky environment map.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{};       // create a scene
auto shape = add_shape(scene);        // add a shape
auto instance = add_instance(scene);  // add a shape instance
set_shape(instance,shape);
add_cameras(scene);                   // add default camera
add_materials(scene);                 // add default materials to instances
add_sky(scene);                       // add environment and procedural sky
```

## Evaluation of scene properties

Yocto/Scene defines several function to evaluate scene properties.
Use `compute_bounds(scene)` to compute the scene bounding boxes. Use `get_camera(scene, name)` to get a camera by name or the default camera is the name is not
given. Use `eval_camera(camera, image_uv, lens_uv)` to get a camera ray
from the normalized image coordinates `image_uv` and lens coordinates `lens_uv`.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};             // create a complete scene
auto camera = get_camera(scene);               // get default camera
auto ray = eval_camera(camera,{0.5,0.5},{0,0});// get ray though image center
```

Use `texture_size(texture)` to get the texture resolution, and
`eval_texture(texture, uv)` to evaluate the texture at specific uvs.
Textures evaluation returns a color in linear color space, regardless of
the texture representation.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};             // create a complete scene
auto texture = scene->textures.front();         // get first texture
auto col = eval_texture(texture,{0.5,0.5});    // eval texture
```

Use `eval_material(material, texcoord)` to evaluate material textures and
combine them with parameter values. The function returns a
`scene_material_sample` that has the same parameters of a material but no
textures defined.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};             // create a complete scene
auto material = scene->materials.front();      // get first material
auto mat = eval_texture(material,{0.5,0.5});   // eval material
```

Several functions are defined to evaluate the geometric and material
properties of points on instances, indicated by the shape element id
and, when needed, the shape element barycentric coordinates.
Use `eval_position(...)` to evaluate the point position,
`eval_normal(...)` to evaluate the interpolate point normal,
`eval_texcoord(...)` to evaluate the point texture coordinates,
`eval_element_normal(...)` to evaluate the point geometric normal, and
`eval_color(...)` to evaluate the interpolate point color.
Use `eval_material(...)` as a convenience function to evaluate material properties of instance points.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};             // create a complete scene
auto instance = scene->instances.front();      // get first instance
auto eid = 0; auto euv = vec3f{0.5,0.5};       // element id and uvs
auto pos  = eval_position(instance, eid, euv); // eval point position
auto norm = eval_normal(instance, eid, euv);   // eval point normal
auto st   = eval_texcoord(instance, eid, euv); // eval point texture coords
auto col  = eval_color(instance, eid, euv);    // eval point color
auto gn   = eval_element_normal(instance, eid, euv); // eval geometric normal
auto mat  = eval_material(instance, eid, euv); // eval point material
```

Use `eval_environment(environment, direction)` to evaluate an environment
map emission along a specific direction `direction`. Use
`eval_environment(scene, direction)` to accumulate the lighting for all
environment maps.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};               // create a complete scene
auto enva = eval_environment(scene, dir);        // eval all environments
auto environment = scene->environments.front();  // get first environment
auto envi = eval_environment(environment, dir);  // eval environment
```

## Ray-scene intersection

Yocto/Scene supports ray-scene intersection queries accelerated by a two-level
BVH. We provide both our implementation and an Embree wrapper. To perform
ray intersection queries, first initialize the BVH with
`init_bvh(scene, params, progress). The function takes a scene as input and builds a BVH that is stored internally. The BVH build strategy, and whether or not Embree is used` is determined by
the `params` settings. The function takes also an optional progress callback
that is called as the BVH is build to report build progress.
After initialization, if scene shapes and instances are modified, the BVH
can be updated with `update_bvh(...)`.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};               // create a complete scene
auto params = scene_bvh_params{};                // default params
auto progress = [](const string& message,        // progress callback
   int current, int total) {
  print_info(message, current, total);
};
init_bvh(scene, params, progress);               // build bvh
params.type = scene_bvh_type::embree_default;    // set build type as Embree
init_bvh(scene, params);        // build Embree bvh with no progress report
```

Use `intersect_scene_bvh(scene, ray)` to intersect a ray with a scene,
and `intersect_instance_bvh(instance, ray)` to intersect a ray with an
instance. Both functions return a `scene_intersection` that includes
a hit flag, the instance id, the shape element id, the shape element uv
and intersection distance.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};          // create a complete scene
init_bvh(scene, {});                        // build default bvh
auto ray = ray3f{...};                      // ray
auto isec = intersect_scene_bvh(scene, ray);// ray-scene intersection
if (isec.hit) print_info(isec);
auto instance = scene->instances.first();   // get instance
auto iisec = intersect_instance_bvh(instance, ray); // ray-instance int,
if (iisec.hit) print_info(isec);
```

## Scene tesselation

The evaluation functions defined above and the ray intersection functions do
not support subdivision surfaces or displaced shapes directly. Instead,
shapes should be converted to indexed meshes using `tesselate_shape(shape)`
for a specific shape, or `tesselate_shapes(scene, progress)` for the
whole scene. Note that tesselations are destructive, meaning that the original
shape data is lost. This is done to avoid copying whenever possible.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};          // create a complete scene
void tesselate_shapes(scene);               // tesselate shapes in the scene
```

## Scene stats and validation

Yocto/Scene has functions to compute scene stats and provide validation of
scene data. Use `scene_stats(scene)` to get scene stats and
`scene_validation(scene)` to validate scene objects.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};          // create a complete scene
auto stats = scene_stats(scene);            // get stats
for(auto stat : stats) print_info(stat);    // print stats
auto errors = validate_stats(scene);        // get validation errors
for(auto error : errors) print_error(error);// print error
```

## Example scenes

Yocto/Scene has a function to create a simple Cornell Box scene for testing.
There are plans to increase support for more test scenes in the future.

```cpp
auto scene = new scene_model{...};          // create a complete scene
make_cornellbox(scene);                     // make cornell box
```
