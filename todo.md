## Test scenes: simplify shape generation

- bent floor
- 0 roughness

## OpenGL/Trace

- investigate bump map on GPU
    - <https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/162857-Computing-the-tangent-space-in-the-fragment-shader>
    - <http://jbit.net/~sparky/sfgrad_bump/mm_sfgrad_bump.pdf>

## BVH

- SAH based build?
- simplify build code: can we avoid pre-allocating nodes?
- move away from special functions in BVH?
    - always use sort
    - provide a sort buffer
- add cutout to trace
- simplify build functions
- maybe put axis with internal
- simplify partition and nth_element function
    - include wrapper functions

## Math

- consider removing const refs
- frame inverse with flag
- check random shuffle
- check random number generation for float/double

## OpenMP

On Apple Clang, you need to add several options to use OpenMP's front end
instead of the standard driver option. This usually looks like
  -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -lomp

You might need to make sure the lib and include directories are discoverable
if /usr/local is not searched:

  -L/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include

For CMake, the following flags will cause the OpenMP::OpenMP_CXX target to
be set up correctly:
  -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include" -DOpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES="omp" -DOpenMP_omp_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib/libomp.dylib

## Book

- apps
    - tonemap
    - naivetrace
    - pathtrace
    - itrace
- lib
    - trace.h / trace.cpp
    - traceio.h / traceio.cpp
