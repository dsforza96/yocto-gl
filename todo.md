# Notes on future improvements of Yocto/GL

This file contains notes on future improvements of Yocto.
Please consider this to be just development notes and not any real planning.

## Next features

- io without exception in the interface
    - load/save that take error code as param
    - eventually we witch to std::expected
- add back texture info
    - helps mapping from files
    - helps with reuse of volume textures
- images
    - need to preserve color space to be able to properly work on images
    - for now, focus on srgb primaries, but start porting other spaces too
    - provide a way to view color spaces in yimview
    - color spaces useful
        - srgb / linear srgb
        - rec2020 / linear rec2020 ?
        - acescg, acescc, acescct
        - some log space
    - practical solution
        - assume srgb, but still label all things clearly
        - do proper srgb coversion
        - imageio supports only srgb for now since the base library do not 
          have access to color profiles
            - check if we can gey access to profiles
        - texture
            - store image4f and image4b data
        - opengl
            - support floating point textures and srgb internal formats 
        - imview
            - this is to be defined
            - problably, do two cases
                - hdr images / linear with srgb primaries
                - ldr image / non-linear with srgb primaries
            - store images in their original form
            - then either provide two separate editing pipelines
            - in general, it feels that we should still have a similar pipeline
              with carefully designed spaces, e.g. using log and always starting
              from a linear representation -> still perform everything in 
              floating point

## Additional Notes

### Tonemapping and HDR

- Frostbite HDR
    - from "High Dynamic Range color grading and diksplay in Frostbite"
    - Legacy:
        - hdr/linear -> 
          tonemap/linear -> 
          srgb/non-linear[0-1] -> 
          grading (lut) -> 
          display
    - Current
        - hdr/linear ->
          to lut space/non-linear -> 
          grading (lut) -> 
          to hdr/linear -> 
          tonemap/non-linear for each output (srgb, hdr10) ->
          display
    - Lut space is PQ for now
    - Consider doing it in ACES instead for more compatibility
- COD HDR pipeline
- Filmic Worlds
    - 
- ACES
    - need to read more about this
    - non exact diagram below, but very reasonable
    - raw(non-linear encoding or linear exr) -> [input transform] ->
      aces linear (acescg) -> [look modificartion transform] ->
      aces non-linear (acescc or acescct) -> [color grading] ->
      aces linear (acescg) -> [reference rendering transform] (filminc tone mapping) ->
      aces linear -> [output tranform] ->
      device-dependent color space

### OpenMP

On Apple Clang, you need to add several options to use OpenMP's front end
instead of the standard driver option. This usually looks like
  -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -lomp

You might need to make sure the lib and include directories are discoverable
if /usr/local is not searched:

  -L/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include

For CMake, the following flags will cause the OpenMP::OpenMP_CXX target to
be set up correctly:
  -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAGS="-Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include" -DOpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES="omp" -DOpenMP_omp_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib/libomp.dylib
