# Notes on future improvements of Yocto/GL

This file contains notes on future improvements of Yocto.
Please consider this to be just development notes and not any real planning.

## Main features

    - hardcode gamma 2.2 in viewer
    - softward tonemap in other
    - remove filmic3?
- removal of dependencies for .h
- removal of dependencies for .cpp
- move as much code as possible to .cpp

- removing std::
- numeric_limits: can we remove it?
    - or put it where it is used
- include math functions without crap

- consider removing
    - logger (make it a function)
    - streams -> to_string
    - cmdline -> check streams

## One shape

- change shape to use constant radius, fixed color
- hairball scene needs splitting for now
- update list marks shape buffers
- scene with name
- tesselation takes tags
- OpenGL with multiple index buffers
    - OpenGL updates: rebuild all buffers or detect if same size
    - selection carries shape ids
- BVH with multiple primitives
- All functions take all primitives
- shape with type
- facet_shape and friends are not virtual in API

## Test scenes: simnplify shape generation

- substance-like shader ball
- squircle
- bent floor
- add cube based tesselation for cylinder, disk
- use welding instead of complex grids
- 0 roughness

## OpenGL/Trace

- investigate bump map on GPU

    - http://jbit.net/~sparky/sfgrad_bump/mm_sfgrad_bump.pdf

## Scene Import

- PBR in OBJ
    - http://exocortex.com/blog/extending_wavefront_mtl_to_support_pbr
    - Pr/map_Pr (roughness) // new
    - Pm/map_Pm (metallic) // new
    - Ps/map_Ps (sheen) // new

## yView

    - check glTF write
    - extend OBJ
- bug in light detection
    - check mcguire car
- cutout not working on yview
    - consider cutout by default
- add print scene info button to yview/ytrace
- add view cam settings

## BVH

- SAH based build?
- simplify build code: can we avoid preallocating nodes?
- move away from special functions in BVH?
    - always use sort
    - provide a sort buffer
- add cutout to trace

- maybe put axis with internal
- simplify partition and nth_element function
    - include wrapper functions


## Deployment

- shorter doc formatting
- postponed: Doxygen and Sphynx
- postponed: consider amalgamation for yocto and ext

## Math

- consider types without constructors
- consider removing const refs
- make make_basis
- span
- make_vec
- generic transform with make_vec and project_homogeneous
- frame inverse with flag
- make stronger the assumption on the use of frames
    - frame inversion
    - documentation
- check random shuffle
- check random number generation for float/double
- check rotation and decompoaition of rotations
   - see euclideanspace.com

## Scene

- add material to env
- remove node children: use stable sort
- share texture info accross GPU/tracer/scene
- make texture info more complete with mirroring and mipmapping
- update convert functions to new api (?)
- cleanup tesselation in shape
    - remove tesselate once
    - tesselation uses only internal levels

## Low-level code

- serialization with visitor?
    - decide if exposing json is reasonable (no, move to C++17 any when possible)
      for now this is just a matter of compilation time
      later it is best to use a variant type
- serialization to JSON as the main reflection model

## Ui

- update imgui and imgui opengl3
    - consider gl3w since ImGui integrates it and it is small
- consider not using sliders
- cleanup scene widgets
- add angle semantic
- add rotation
- add frame editing with decomposition
- add labels 2,3,4
- consider disabling visitors and using JSON serialization with schema-like things

## yScnProc

- general fixup
- print info
